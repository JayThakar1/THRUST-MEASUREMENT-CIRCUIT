Dear VECROS team,

as per your requirnment here is my task given by hiring team, VECROS. In this circuit i have used I2C communication protocoal to communiate and transfer data between Arduino UNO and ESP-32 devices. In this circuit XT60 is a banana jack for input power supply connector. The WCS-1700 is a header for current sensor module, the BE-002754 and XL7015 are DC-DC converter used to give reduced power supply to various devices on the board. the SKU 766355 is a RPM mesaurement sensor. In addition to this circit we can also add a volatage sensor and connections for BLDC motor driver as per requirenment.
